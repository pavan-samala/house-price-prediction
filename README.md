# house-price-prediction
This project is a complete machine learning workflow built to predict house prices using Kaggleâ€™s House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset. It demonstrates practical knowledge of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling
Uploaded the official Kaggle datasets used for model training and testing:
- train.csv: Includes housing features and target SalePrice
- test.csv: Includes features for which predictions can be generated

Note: These files are necessary to reproduce the results in HousePricePrediction.ipynb.
